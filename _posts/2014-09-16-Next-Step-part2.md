###Database Project

In this project, we create a fully functional C++ program that implements a simple database application. 

Our program will allow us to manage a database od composers and relevant information about them. The features of the program include:

- The ability to add a new composer
- The ability to rank a composer (i.e. indicate how much we like or dislike the composer's music)
- The ability to view all the composers in the database
- The ability to view all composers by rank

> "There are two ways of constructing a software design : One way is to make it so simple that there are obniously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." - [C.A.R. Hoare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare)
