The following exercises will give you more practice with basic C++. The solutions will be provided in the next blog. :)

###Exercise 1
The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current temperature. Adding 40 to the number of time a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing that value by 4 gives us the temperature. Write a program that takes as input the number of chirps in a minute and prints the current temperature. For example,

>Number of chirps: 120 <br>
>The temperature is: 40.0 degrees.

###Exercise 2
Write a program that will compute your final grade for a programming course you are taking. Here is the grading scheme:

>Final grades will be based on the following:<br>
>40% Assignments   15% Midterm Examination <br>
>35% Final Examination <br>
>10% Class Participation Grade
